# HashMap Project

## Overview

This project is a visual representation of a HashMap data structure, implemented using JavaScript. It demonstrates various HashMap operations such as adding, retrieving, and removing key-value pairs, as well as handling collisions and resizing the map. The visualization helps users understand how HashMaps store data internally.

## Features

- **HashMap Class**: A custom implementation of a HashMap with methods including:

  - `set(key, value)`: Adds a key-value pair to the map.
  - `get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with a key.
  - `has(key)`: Checks if the map contains a specific key.
  - `keys()`: Returns an array of all keys in the map.
  - `values()`: Returns an array of all values in the map.
  - `entries()`: Returns an array of all key-value pairs in the map.
  - `remove(key)`: Removes a key-value pair from the map.
  - `clear()`: Clears all entries in the map.
  - `resize()`: Resizes the internal storage when the load factor exceeds a threshold.
- **Interactive Visualization**: A user-friendly interface to visualize the HashMap's structure and operations, including:

  - Buckets representing each index in the map.
  - Key-value pairs displayed within the buckets.
  - Dynamic updates to show changes in real-time.
