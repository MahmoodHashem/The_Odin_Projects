# Testing Practice with Jest

I practiced writing unit tests for various JavaScript functions, enhancing my understanding of testing principles and the Jest framework.

## Project Overview

This project includes unit tests for the following functions:

- **Calculator**: Performs basic arithmetic operations.
- **Capitalize**: Capitalizes the first letter of a given string.
- **Reverse String**: Reverses a given string.
- **Caesar Cipher**: Implements the Caesar cipher encryption technique.
- **Analyze Array**: Takes an array of numbers and returns an object containing the average, minimum, maximum, and length of the array.

Each function is tested using Jest's `describe` and `toBe` matcher for clear and structured assertions.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The programming language used for the functions.
- **Jest**: A delightful JavaScript testing framework.
