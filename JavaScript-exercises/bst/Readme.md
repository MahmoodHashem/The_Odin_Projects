## Features

- **Node Class**: Represents each node in the BST with properties for its value and references to left and right child nodes.
- **BST Class**: Offers a variety of methods for manipulating the tree:
  - **Insert**: Add values to the tree while maintaining order.
  - **Remove**: Delete specified values from the tree.
  - **Clear All**: Remove all nodes from the tree.
  - **Balance**: Reorganize the tree to ensure optimal performance.
  - **Check Balance**: Determine if the tree is balanced.
  - **Traversals**: Perform pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals to explore tree structure.
  - **Height Calculations**: Find the height, maximum height, and minimum height of the tree.
- **Interactive Visualization**: A user-friendly web interface that allows users to:
  - Insert new values and see real-time tree updates.
  - Balance the tree with a single click.
  - Remove nodes and observe the changes.
  - Perform and visualize different tree traversals.
  - Display maximum and minimum heights of the tree.

## Usage

1. **Insert Values** : Enter a value in the input field and click "`Add`" to add it to the BST.
2. **Remove Values** : Specify a value and click "`Remove`" to delete it from the tree.
3. **Clear Tree:** Click `clearAll` to Clear all the tree
4. **Balance the Tree** : Click "`Balance`" to reorganize the tree for optimal performance.
5. **Perform Traversals** : Select a traversal method to visualize the order of node visits.
6. **Height Analysis** : Use the "`Max Height`" and "`Min Height`" buttons to retrieve height information.

## Visual Representation

The application includes an intuitive visual representation of the BST. Nodes are displayed as numbers, with lines connecting parents to children, allowing users to easily see the structure of the tree as they perform operations.

## Technologies Used
